<h1>Turn Based Arena Game</h1>

<h2>Idea</h2>
<p>This game is based on typical mobile arena games like Raid Shadow Legends. The game is made for pc on a WEBGL framework.</p>

<h2>Concept</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Campaign story</li>
  <li>Arena battles</li>
  <li>Training battles</li>
</ul>

<h2>Campaign story</h2>

<p>In the campaign story the player will have to defeat the shadow master. The shadow master has corrupted everything in the world bringing out the darkness. All diffrent kinds of bad things have appeared from the shadows. The player needs to free the world and end the torture the citizens have to endure. The player will encounter extremely strong enemies which prove a challenge and put the players warriors through tough battles.</p>

<h2>Arena battles</h2>

<p>The arena battles are offline made. The system will pick a random set of players and compare them to the players stats. The most matching player will then be selected. This way the game will mostly be balanced and cheating can hopfully be prevented. This also makes it cheaper to make since no dedicated servers need to be purchased. An arena battle is almost similair to a campaign battle only the player will earn more gold and xp with the arena battles. And it can also add tough challenge to the game.</p>
